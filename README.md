# Things to know

This project is to pay tribute to my Java and Android Development teacher [Mr.Jin](http://jinxuliang.com).

The APP: **WEATHER MEOW** is a simple application to show the current weather. It is built according to, but not all based on, **Material Design Guidelines.**

The main UI is to pay tribute to Apple's App Store Design (iOS 11.3 Version).
