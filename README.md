# Things to know

> Proudly produced by [CatInTheBox.Inc](https://spencerwoo.com)

This project is to tribute my Java and Android Development teacher [Mr.Jin](http://jinxuliang.com) who is a spectacular man with great knowledge and is willing to give.

The APP: **WEATHER MEOW** is basically a simple application to show the current weather. It is built according to, but not all based on, **Material Design Guidelines.**

The main UI is to tribute Apple's App Store Design (iOS 11.3 Version).
